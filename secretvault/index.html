    <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
    <div class="date">February 21, 2026</div>

    <p>This Privacy Policy applies to the <strong>Secret Vault: Save Photos</strong> mobile application (the "Application"). The Application is provided as an independent service and is intended for use "AS IS".</p>

    <h2>Information Collection and Use</h2>

    <p>The Application is designed with privacy in mind.</p>

    <p><strong>We do not collect, store, sell, rent, or share your personal data.</strong></p>

    <p>The Application does not require account creation and does not collect personally identifiable information such as your name, address, phone number, or email unless you voluntarily contact us.</p>

    <h2>Photo & Media Data</h2>

    <p>All photos, videos, and media files stored within the Application remain exclusively on your device.</p>

    <ul>
        <li>No photos or media files are uploaded to or stored on our servers.</li>
        <li>No media content is stored in external databases.</li>
        <li>No photos or files are accessed or reviewed by us.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>The Application does not retain copies of your media outside of what you explicitly save within the vault on your device.</p>

    <h2>Photo Library Access</h2>

    <p>The Application requires access to your device's photo library solely to allow you to import photos and videos into the vault. This access is used only when you actively choose to add media and is never used to scan, upload, or share your photo library without your explicit action.</p>

    <h2>Vault Security & PIN/Biometric Access</h2>

    <p>The Application may use a PIN code, Face ID, or Touch ID to protect access to your vault. These credentials are handled entirely by your device's secure operating system and are never transmitted to or stored on our servers.</p>

    <h2>AI Processing Disclosure</h2>

    <p>Any AI-assisted features within the Application, such as photo organization or enhancement, operate locally on your device.</p>

    <p><strong>No photo data, media content, or personal information is shared with any artificial intelligence service, external API, or third-party AI provider.</strong></p>

    <p>Your content is never used to train AI models.</p>

    <h2>Third-Party Services</h2>

    <p>The Application does not share your photos or media data with any third-party service.</p>

    <p>If analytics, crash reporting, or advertising services are used in the future, they will not have access to your photos, media files, or vault contents.</p>

    <h2>Data Security</h2>

    <p>All media processing and storage occurs locally on your device. The Application uses standard platform-level security protections provided by iOS, including encryption at rest, to safeguard your files.</p>

    <p>While no digital system can guarantee absolute security, reasonable technical and administrative safeguards are implemented to protect your data.</p>

    <h2>Data Retention</h2>

    <p>Since the Application does not collect or store personal data on external servers, we do not retain user data. All photos and media are stored locally on your device under your full control.</p>

    <p>If you uninstall the Application, any locally stored vault data is removed from your device according to your device's operating system policies.</p>

    <h2>Children's Privacy</h2>

    <p>The Application is not intended for children under the age of 13. We do not knowingly collect any personal information from children.</p>

    <h2>Changes to This Policy</h2>

    <p>This Privacy Policy may be updated from time to time. Any changes will be reflected on this page with a revised date.</p>

    <h2>Your Consent</h2>

    <p>By using the Application, you agree to this Privacy Policy.</p>
