    <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
    <div class="date">February 17, 2026</div>

    <p>This Privacy Policy applies to the <strong>eSign Docs: AI Signature Maker</strong> mobile application (the "Application"). The Application is provided as an independent service and is intended for use "AS IS".</p>

    <h2>Information Collection and Use</h2>

    <p>The Application is designed with privacy in mind.</p>

    <p><strong>We do not collect, store, sell, rent, or share your personal data.</strong></p>

    <p>The Application does not require account creation and does not collect personally identifiable information such as your name, address, phone number, or email unless you voluntarily contact us.</p>

    <h2>Document & Signature Data</h2>

    <p>All documents, signatures, and related data processed within the Application remain on your device.</p>

    <ul>
        <li>No documents are uploaded to our servers.</li>
        <li>No signatures are stored on external databases.</li>
        <li>No document content is accessed by us.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>The Application does not retain copies of your signed documents.</p>

    <h2>AI Processing Disclosure</h2>

    <p>The AI-based signature enhancement features operate locally within the Application.</p>

    <p><strong>No document data, signature data, or personal information is shared with any artificial intelligence service, external API, or third-party AI provider.</strong></p>

    <p>Your content is never used for training AI models.</p>

    <h2>Third-Party Services</h2>

    <p>The Application does not share document data or signature data with any third-party service.</p>

    <p>If analytics, crash reporting, or advertising services are used in the future, they will not have access to your document content or signature information.</p>

    <h2>Data Security</h2>

    <p>All document processing occurs locally on your device. The Application uses standard platform-level security protections provided by iOS to safeguard your information.</p>

    <p>While no digital system can guarantee absolute security, reasonable technical and administrative safeguards are implemented.</p>

    <h2>Data Retention</h2>

    <p>Since the Application does not collect or store personal data on external servers, we do not retain user data.</p>

    <p>If you uninstall the Application, any locally stored data is removed from your device according to your device’s operating system policies.</p>

    <h2>Children’s Privacy</h2>

    <p>The Application is not intended for children under the age of 13. We do not knowingly collect any personal information from children.</p>

    <h2>Changes to This Policy</h2>

    <p>This Privacy Policy may be updated from time to time. Any changes will be reflected on this page with a revised date.</p>

    <h2>Your Consent</h2>

    <p>By using the Application, you agree to this Privacy Policy.</p>
