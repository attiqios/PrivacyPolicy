    <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
    <div class="date">February 21, 2026</div>

    <p>This Privacy Policy applies to the <strong>Live Translation: AI Translate</strong> mobile application (the "Application"). The Application is provided as an independent service and is intended for use "AS IS".</p>

    <h2>Information Collection and Use</h2>

    <p>The Application is designed with privacy in mind.</p>

    <p><strong>We do not collect, store, sell, rent, or share your personal data.</strong></p>

    <p>The Application does not require account creation and does not collect personally identifiable information such as your name, address, phone number, or email unless you voluntarily contact us.</p>

    <h2>Audio & Transcription Data</h2>

    <p>All audio recorded for live translation and transcription is processed within the Application and is not retained after your session ends.</p>

    <ul>
        <li>No audio recordings are uploaded to or stored on our servers.</li>
        <li>No transcriptions or translated text are stored in external databases.</li>
        <li>No audio or speech content is accessed or reviewed by us.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>The Application does not retain copies of your conversations, transcriptions, or translations.</p>

    <h2>Microphone Access</h2>

    <p>The Application requires access to your device's microphone solely to enable live translation and transcription features. Microphone access is only active while you are actively using these features and is never used for background recording.</p>

    <h2>AI Processing Disclosure</h2>

    <p>The AI-based translation and transcription features may utilize on-device processing or trusted third-party AI services to deliver accurate results. Where third-party services are used, audio and text data are transmitted securely and are not stored, sold, or used for training AI models beyond the scope of processing your immediate request.</p>

    <p><strong>Your content is never used to train AI models without your explicit consent.</strong></p>

    <h2>Third-Party Services</h2>

    <p>The Application may use trusted translation or speech recognition APIs to power its core features. These services receive only the minimum data necessary to perform the translation or transcription and are contractually obligated not to retain or misuse your data.</p>

    <p>If analytics, crash reporting, or advertising services are used in the future, they will not have access to your audio content or transcription data.</p>

    <h2>Data Security</h2>

    <p>Audio and text processing is handled with industry-standard encryption during transmission. The Application uses standard platform-level security protections provided by iOS to safeguard your information.</p>

    <p>While no digital system can guarantee absolute security, reasonable technical and administrative safeguards are implemented to protect your data.</p>

    <h2>Data Retention</h2>

    <p>Since the Application does not collect or store personal data on external servers, we do not retain user data. Session audio and transcription data are discarded once your session ends.</p>

    <p>If you uninstall the Application, any locally stored data is removed from your device according to your device's operating system policies.</p>

    <h2>Children's Privacy</h2>

    <p>The Application is not intended for children under the age of 13. We do not knowingly collect any personal information from children.</p>

    <h2>Changes to This Policy</h2>

    <p>This Privacy Policy may be updated from time to time. Any changes will be reflected on this page with a revised date.</p>

    <h2>Your Consent</h2>

    <p>By using the Application, you agree to this Privacy Policy.</p>

    <h2>Contact Us</h2>

    <p>If you have any questions regarding this Privacy Policy, please contact us at:
